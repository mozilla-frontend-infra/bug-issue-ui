  ## About Release Engineering
 
  We ship Firefox to the world!

  Release Engineering does this by:

  * Developing world-class, scalable, open, secure, and maintainable infrastructure for application builds and tests, on a diverse set of desktop and mobile platforms
  * Building fast and reliable pipelines to transform source code into shipped products.

  ## Who Works on Release Engineering?

  There are currently 12 people working full time on the team. We have a number of active contributors for various projects and a long history
  of folks who have helped scale us up to where we are today.

  The core team can be found [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering#Team). We are very distributed across North America, Europe, and New Zealand.

  ## How Do I Get Started?

  If you are working on a bug (in Bugzilla), you may need to [create a new account](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/createaccount.cgi).
  If you are working on an issue (in Github), you will need a Github account.

  Comment in the bug or issue to say that you are working on it, and ask any questions that you have at that time.
  But do your research!
  Look the other comments, look at the documentation and source code, and try to figure out as much as you can first.
  This helps you learn more about Release Engineering and understand better the bug you're fixing or feature you're adding.

  Learn more about our core [offerings](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering#Releng_Offerings) and [applications](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering#Releng_Applications)

  To understand how we do things, at a high level, see the following onboarding presentation [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nUrZ8abpNnC5sYV97ePbUhLNu7La66JE4HEdEy1IdU8/edit?usp=sharing)

  ### How Do I Write the Code?
 
  Our code is mostly within Github repositories in the [mozilla-releng organization](https://github.com/mozilla-releng). We also contribute a lot
  of "in-tree" code. That is, code that lives within the main [Firefox repository](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central). Primarly this can be
  found under our build and release scheduling configuration logic within [taskgraph](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/taskcluster),
  and our script harness, [mozharness](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/testing/mozharness) we use for writing build and release logic..

  Once you've figured out which repository to use, clone it and -- before you change anything -- run the tests.
  The repository or base directory's README file will describe how to set up and run tests.

  For Github repositories, follow the pull-request process: make a fork of the repository, make your changes on a branch, and then create a pull request
  from that branch. The Internet is full of guides for this process, and of course we are happy to help as well.

  For Mercurial and the Firefox repository, follow the [commit agreement](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/commit/) and then see
  the main [developing documention](https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

  ## How Do I Get Help?

  The best place to talk about a bug or issue is in the comments.
  Don't be afraid to ask questions or describe how you are solving the problem.
  That way, anyone watching the bug can answer your questions or offer useful advice.
  Each bug has a mentor, and that person will usually be the one to reply.

  We are also available on [irc](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC) in the `#ci` channel.
  That's a great place to get quick help. Look for one of our [team's nicks](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering#Team) in that channel.
