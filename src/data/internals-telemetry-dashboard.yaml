  ## About the Telemetry Portal
  
  The [Telemetry Portal](https://telemetry.mozilla.org/) is a one-stop shop for accessing public and mozilla-specific
  data dashboards and documentation. There you can explore aggregated Firefox anonymous usage statistics on the
  Measurement Dashboard, learn what data is collected on which versions in the Probe Dictionary, and more.
  
  ## Who Works On the Telemetry Portal?
  
  The Data Engineering team, a group of developers spanning timezones UTC+2 to UTC-8, maintain and develop the index,
  documentation, and some of the tools and dashboards hosted on [https://telemetry.mozilla.org](https://telemetry.mozilla.org).
  We do [other things](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/pipeline/data_pipeline.html), too.
  
  ## How Do I Get Started?
  
  The code for the Telemetry Portal is in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-dashboard/).
  There you can find open issues that need work. Volunteer by commenting on an issue and we'll assign it to you.
  
  ## How Do I Write the Code?
  
  Fork the telemetry-dashboard repository, prepare your commits locally, and push to your GitHub Pages branch so we can get
  a live picture of your changes. File a Pull Request including a link to your GitHub Pages where the live website is rendering,
  marking one or two of us for review. 
  
  We should get back to you within two business days. If we haven't, we've probably missed your Pull Request, so please remind
  us by @-mentioning the reviewers' names in the PR or visiting us on the #telemetry channel on [IRC](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Irc/).
  
  ## How Do I Get Help?
  
  Commenting on Issues and Pull Requests will get our attention eventually, but if your question would benefit from
  more direct communication, please connect to the #telemetry channel on [IRC](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Irc). Most hours
  of the day someone will be there to help you. Introduce yourself, include a link of the Issue or Pull Request, and give us
  a couple of minutes to get back to you.
